GoGTFS
======

GTFS Package and webapp in Go. For now it imports GTFS data in memory, it's 
fairly fast given that some level of linking is done on the data. A few methods 
allow to query the data. A webapp is also included, it is intended to be capable
of editing the loaded data, but for now only shows the shapes on a google map.
