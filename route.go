type Route struct {

	// route_id - Required. The route_id field contains an ID that uniquely identifies a route. The route_id is dataset unique.
	Id string

	// agency_id - Optional. The agency_id field defines an agency for the specified route. This value is referenced from the
	// agency.txt file. Use this field when you are providing data for routes from more than one agency.
	Agency *Agency

	// route_short_name - Required. The route_short_name contains the short name of a route. This will often be a short,
	// abstract identifier like "32", "100X", or "Green" that riders use to identify a route, but which doesn't give any
	// indication of what places the route serves. If the route does not have a short name, please specify a route_long_name
	// and use an empty string as the value for this field.
	// See a Google Maps screenshot highlighting the route_short_name:
	// http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html#transitShortNameScreenshot
	ShortName string

	// route_long_name - Required. The route_long_name contains the full name of a route. This name is generally more
	// descriptive than the route_short_name and will often include the route's destination or stop. If the route does
	// not have a long name, please specify a route_short_name and use an empty string as the value for this field.
	// See a Google Maps screenshot highlighting the route_long_name:
	// http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html#transitLongNameScreenshot
	LongName string

	// route_desc - Optional. The route_desc field contains a description of a route. Please provide useful, quality
	// information. Do not simply duplicate the name of the route. For example, "A trains operate between Inwood-207 St,
	// Manhattan and Far Rockaway-Mott Avenue, Queens at all times. Also from about 6AM until about midnight, additional
	// A trains operate between Inwood-207 St and Lefferts Boulevard (trains typically alternate between Lefferts Blvd and Far Rockaway)."
	Desc string

	// route_type - Required. The route_type field describes the type of transportation used on a route. Valid values for this field are:
	// 		0 - Tram, Streetcar, Light rail. Any light rail or street level system within a metropolitan area.
	// 		1 - Subway, Metro. Any underground rail system within a metropolitan area.
	// 		2 - Rail. Used for intercity or long-distance travel.
	// 		3 - Bus. Used for short- and long-distance bus routes.
	// 		4 - Ferry. Used for short- and long-distance boat service.
	// 		5 - Cable car. Used for street-level cable cars where the cable runs beneath the car.
	// 		6 - Gondola, Suspended cable car. Typically used for aerial cable cars where the car is suspended from the cable.
	// 		7 - Funicular. Any rail system designed for steep inclines.

	Type byte

	// route_url - Optional. The route_url field contains the URL of a web page about that particular route. This should be
	// different from the agency_url.
	// The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must
	// be correctly escaped. See http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to
	// create fully qualified URL values.
	Url string

	// route_color	- Optional. In systems that have colors assigned to routes, the route_color field defines a color that
	// corresponds to a route. The color must be provided as a six-character hexadecimal number, for example, 00FFFF. If no
	// color is specified, the default route color is white (FFFFFF).
	// The color difference between route_color and route_text_color should provide sufficient contrast when viewed on a
	// black and white screen. The W3C Techniques for Accessibility Evaluation And Repair Tools document offers a useful
	// algorithm for evaluating color contrast. There are also helpful online tools for choosing contrasting colors, including
	// the snook.ca Color Contrast Check application: http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html
	Color string

	// route_text_color - Optional. The route_text_color field can be used to specify a legible color to use for text drawn
	// against a background of route_color. The color must be provided as a six-character hexadecimal number, for example,
	// FFD700. If no color is specified, the default text color is black (000000).
	// The color difference between route_color and route_text_color should provide sufficient contrast when viewed on a
	// black and white screen.
